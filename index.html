We used to get along, we used to have fun together, laugh and love. Then we had the kids and got a mortgage and car payments. Karen had to quit her job, I've been working 2 shifts - I can't remember the last time we had a real conversation, let alone had an intimate moment. Life, man, am I right? Oh. Yeah, Salmon Cookies are alright.</h4>
