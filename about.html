          <p>A long time ago, Pat asked himself a question that you should probably ask yourself at least once in life, "Why not a Salmon Cookie?" He came up with a secret family recipe and now you can enjoy the authentic taste of wild Salmon Cookies too. Our cookie batches are individually paw made with only the freshest of ingredients. We source locally, use only organic ingredients and pay our workers an honest amount of honey because we believe in growing our community with us and care about sustainable and healthy living. Drop by any of our local stores and tell 'em ol' Pat sent you!</p>
